# TryHackMe Offensive Pentesting Path Notes
Some of my neater notes for a few of the more challenging machines as well as Active Directory machines from the Offensive Pentesting Path in TryHackMe. Need [CherryTree](https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree) to use these. Comes installed on Kali by default.

## How to use these?
These are not really writeups but examples of how to jot down thoughts during enumeration process. Should be used mainly as inspiration to come up with documenting methods that work for the individual tester.

## Format
The directories correspond to a certain section in the path. Subdirectories are for a few of the machines. Each subdirectory contains notes.ctb, and accompaning screenshots.

## Template used
For a few machines I used the BOX-SKELETON.ctb  which can be found [here](https://github.com/unmeg/hax). I like this template because it can be a useful guide to enumeration process.

# To Do
